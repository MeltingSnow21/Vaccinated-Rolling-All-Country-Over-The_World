# Vaccinated-Rolling-All-Country-Over-The_World

This is a scrip of SQL for finding 
the rolling amount of vaccinated people all over the world based on the country

I also added some looking queries like queries for
 - Finding total cases compared with population (specific country)
 - Finding total cases compared with the number of death cases (specific country)
 - Showing the country with the highest death per population
-- Showing the country the highest death percentage
 - Daily cases in global
 - total cases in all periods (2020 - 2022)
 - Comparison of population and vaccination in global
 - Percent population of vaccinated in global per country

The Excel these used are 2 file of death cases and vaccinated cases and conduct one file for rolling vaccinated cases 

- Export excel to db server
- runn the sql file

this also can run the visualization using notebook
